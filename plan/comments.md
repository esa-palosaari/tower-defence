# Project plan comments from Miikka

Good overall plan. Some comments:

  * Good and detailed verbal explanation of the software and gameplay.

  * Good that you have a software architectural pattern in mind and the design is
    well planned. The web links you provided in the plan do not mention anything
    about game development though. Perhaps you could look into some documents
    about the MVP model used in game development?

  * Class structure looks good and justified. Would it be logical to derive the classes
    Enemy, Tower, Projectile and Homebase from an abstract class, e.g. GameObject? Your
    current design of using an update-function for updating each object perioidically
    suggests for the use of a common class.

  * Project schedule is well put together keeping in mind the milestones.

  * Division of work is detailed.

  * Very good that in the design you have taken into account the possibility of adding
    a multiplayer mode later on.

  * Do you have a main platform you are using for development and
    testing the software?

**Score: 3/3**
